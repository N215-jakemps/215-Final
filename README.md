# 215 Final Project: Eventsy
## culminating all the skills learned in this development course into one cohesive website

<br/>
<br/>

This is the final project for N215. We were tasked with combining the adaptive and repsonsive techniques and tools we learned throughout the semester to build a single page dynamic site with multiple variations of information and layouts. 

Some key features include, two unique headers, a unique footer, and navigation using the upcoming events, gallery, and blog sections. As well as scaling for multiple screen sizes for all webpages.
